# Tensorflow Object Detection API - Single Shot Detector - Mobilenet V1 COCO

This repository includes:

- Installation on Google Colab, applicable to Linux too for Tensorflow Models on Google Colab.

- Preparations of annotations files, tensorflow records previous to training on Google Colab.

- Tensorflow Training on Google Colab.

- Tensorflow to TensorRT Optimization on Google Colab.

- The Jetson Nano folder contains the results if you want to test it directly

**NOTE: For deployment on the Jetson you need to install tensorflow models and tensorflow to tensorrt from nvidia ai iot repository.  Instructions will be uploaded later but you could see the requirements.txt file for check.**
